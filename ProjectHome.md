Provides a better way to query data paths from the OS.

JDataPath is meant for fixing the ["user.home" property bug](http://bugs.sun.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=4787931) on windows. But it can also provide "recommended" data location for other platforms as well.

Look at the [main interface](http://code.google.com/p/jdatapath/source/browse/trunk/src/java/com/codeberry/jdatapath/LocalDataPathSystem.java) to see what JDataPath can do.
